Jira time logger script
=======================

**Script is used to log time spent on tasks *worklog***
***

* Currently timezone is mounted to ***Europe/Berlin*** and changes between ***CEST/CET based on system time***.

* Function is working on ***jira cloud***, in order to migrate to server version, head to jira docs.

## ***SETUP:***

* **In order to log time correctly, create .env file in top level directory, and provide fields listed under:**

* **Fields in *.env* file**

  * **USER\_EMAIL**=**example\@mail.com**

  * **API\_TOKEN**=**some\_random\_chars**

  * **JIRA\_DOMAIN\_NAME**=**companyname**

* **Fields description:**

  * **JIRA\_DOMAIN\_NAME** is jira domain name -> all between https:// and .atlassian.net

* ticketName, startTimeOfWork - endTimeOfWork, dateOfWorkOnTask (DD-MM)

***
### ***Note***:
* **ticketName** will be changed to upperCase, so you don\'t have to provide it with capslock.

* If you **omit date**, app will treat it as you were working today, and it will log time based on current day + month.
*** 
* Correctly logged time, prints this:

    * **Request 201 Created**
***
* Incorrectly logged time, **prints error**
***
* Logged time will be saved in ***{currentYear}__{currentMonth}.txt*** file in **worklogdoc directory**
    * e.g **2022__07.txt**

## ***How to run a script?***

* Make sure you are in the top directory, run `npm i` to install dependencies,
